## Reflection

### Core concepts:
PID control consists of three components, Proportional(P), Integral(I), and Derivative(D). 

* P is proportional error. Larger P coefficient increases proportional gain, but can lead to strong oscillation, especially if used alone

* I is the accumulation error. Accumulating error could be useful for steady state error, essentially using information of the past.

* D is derivative error, aka, rate of change error. Derivatiev error takes future state into consideration, and therefore can reduce overshooting, essentially projecting information of the future

### Coefficient parameter tuning
This is pretty much the core of this project. There are various ways of doing it, either systematically or via trial and error. In this submission, I did it via trial and error, aka, manually. 

Initially, I used just P control, and clearly the car oscallated heavily to the point that it was not possible to be safe, proving the point that P control alone is not enough. Then D control came into play, followed by I(Integral) control. However, through trial and error, what I found was PD control worked and I(Integral) control did not add much. Probably a more systematical approach like twiddle could find better combinations.

I also added a speed controller to control the car speed. The method of parameter tuning was basically the same. With both controlled, the car could drive more safely than with just steer_angle controller

I recorded a short video of the car driving in the simulator and converted it to a gif to make it small

    Some function signatures have changed in v0.14.x. See [this PR](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-MPC-Project/pull/3) for more details.
* Simulator. You can download these from the [project intro page](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/releases) in the classroom.

Fellow students have put together a guide to Windows set-up for the project [here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-selfdrivingcar/files/Kidnapped_Vehicle_Windows_Setup.pdf) if the environment you have set up for the Sensor Fusion projects does not work for this project. There's also an experimental patch for windows in this [PR](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-PID-Control-Project/pull/3).

## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./pid`. 

Tips for setting up your environment can be found [here](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/0949fca6-b379-42af-a919-ee50aa304e6a/lessons/f758c44c-5e40-4e01-93b5-1a82aa4e044f/concepts/23d376c7-0195-4276-bdf0-e02f1f3c665d)

## Editor Settings

We've purposefully kept editor configuration files out of this repo in order to
keep it as simple and environment agnostic as possible. However, we recommend
using the following settings:

* indent using spaces
* set tab width to 2 spaces (keeps the matrices in source code aligned)

## Code Style

Please (do your best to) stick to [Google's C++ style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).

## Project Instructions and Rubric

Note: regardless of the changes you make, your project must be buildable using
cmake and make!

More information is only accessible by people who are already enrolled in Term 2
of CarND. If you are enrolled, see [the project page](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/f1820894-8322-4bb3-81aa-b26b3c6dcbaf/lessons/e8235395-22dd-4b87-88e0-d108c5e5bbf4/concepts/6a4d8d42-6a04-4aa6-b284-1697c0fd6562)
for instructions and the project rubric.

## Hints!

* You don't have to follow this directory structure, but if you do, your work
  will span all of the .cpp files here. Keep an eye out for TODOs.

## Call for IDE Profiles Pull Requests

Help your fellow students!

We decided to create Makefiles with cmake to keep this project as platform
agnostic as possible. Similarly, we omitted IDE profiles in order to we ensure
that students don't feel pressured to use one IDE or another.

However! I'd love to help people get up and running with their IDEs of choice.
If you've created a profile for an IDE that you think other students would
appreciate, we'd love to have you add the requisite profile files and
instructions to ide_profiles/. For example if you wanted to add a VS Code
profile, you'd add:

* /ide_profiles/vscode/.vscode
* /ide_profiles/vscode/README.md

The README should explain what the profile does, how to take advantage of it,
and how to install it.

Frankly, I've never been involved in a project with multiple IDE profiles
before. I believe the best way to handle this would be to keep them out of the
repo root to avoid clutter. My expectation is that most profiles will include
instructions to copy files to a new location to get picked up by the IDE, but
that's just a guess.

One last note here: regardless of the IDE used, every submitted project must
still be compilable with cmake and make./
